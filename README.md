Project Name :  Face Recognition Attendance System Software 
Facility Technology : Python  
Description :   
            •	An Attendance System Using Face Recognition feature with OpenCV library of Python .  
            •	As well as a CSV to store attendance records. 
            •	creating a dataset of face and train the system with that dataset 
            •	this trained model it implemented attendance system to recognize the face  
            •	and mark the attendance of user using provided user id. 
            •	Use Algorithm : Haarcascade
